# DistributedComputingPj2
Second project for my Distributed Computing classes

Implements a network with multiple users and one shared printer. Uses the Ricart-Agrawala algorythm -- there's no central server, the clients communicate with each other to determine wich one can use the printer as soon as it's avaliable.
